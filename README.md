# FPMOZ Car Rental
FPMOZ Car Rental is a full-stack car rental application developed as part of a college project in collaboration with my colleagues. The project was built using React for the frontend, and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing vehicle rentals and reservations.

The application includes a custom RESTful API that supports role-based authentication, enabling both users and admins to perform secure CRUD operations on vehicles, reservations, and user accounts.

Though the project currently does not use TypeScript due to my colleagues' preference, I am planning on converting the entire project to TypeScript to improve code quality, scalability, and maintainability.


## Frontend technologies | React & Tailwind CSS
For the frontend, I used Create React App due to its simplicity and ease of setup. React offers an efficient component-based architecture for building interactive UIs, while Tailwind CSS was used for styling, providing a flexible and utility-first approach to design that makes the development process faster and more customizable.

## Backend technologies | Node & MongoDB
For the backend, I used Node.js with Express and MongoDB because of their scalability, ease of use, and seamless integration with JavaScript. Node.js handles asynchronous operations efficiently, Express simplifies server-side logic, and MongoDB offers flexibility with its NoSQL database structure.

***In addition to these interfaces, the app includes user registration and login pages with relevant forms. If an admin logs in, they see an admin dashboard with access to all registered users, cars, reservations, where they can perform various CRUD operations.***
